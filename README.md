# Matrix-Optimization

Learned Julia and a set of numerical tools for optimization problems. The course is dedicated for matrix optimization and the assignments let student practice the usage of a lot of useful application tools. This is a documentation for my personal learning experience. 
<br><br>The purpose for this documentation is to 
1) Demonstrate my Julia coding performance
2) Demonstrate my practice of applying linear algebra tools that are frequently used in industry and applications
3) Summarize the knowledge concisely for reflection and review in the future.
